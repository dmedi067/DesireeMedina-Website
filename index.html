        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Desiree Medina and Iâ€™ve been fortunate enough to be involved and be a part of numerous organizations, clubs, internships, etc. Currently, I am a first generation and first year student attending the University of California, Riverside, a fine establishment here in Riverside CA. I am majoring in Pre-Business Administration and hope to apply to the school of business here and officially be a Business Administration major with a concentration in marketing. Previously I attended Francisco Bravo Medical Magnet High School and graduated with high honors in 2022. Then later attending UC Riverside where I continue to pursue my higher education. e<br><br>

        As a first year student Iâ€™ve been interested in numerous organizations the school offers, one organization Iâ€™m currently in is LBSA the Latino Business Student Association. A club that focuses on building up professional individuals to further their goals and aspirations. Aside from what Iâ€™m currently involved in, some of my past accomplishments and past involvements include numerous clubs, internships, like previously mentioned. I was involved in numerous clubs and held a board position for all of them. I was treasurer for multiple years and multiple organizations. One of the most notable was my time with asb and being treasurer for the entirety of my class. It allowed me to grow my leadership skills and develop other skills like my communication, problem solving, and critical thinking skills. I worked with numerous other people, all with different demands which allowed me to flourish in situations that required different solutions. <br><br>

        Now, aside from the plethora of clubs and organizations I was involved in, I also had an internship that allowed me to take a leadership role in a more real life sense. The internship itself was in California State University, Los Angeles. It was a program within CSULA where me and other like minded individuals were involved in to grow our skills. Throughout the internship we did numerous group projects and assignments that allowed me to work with others and find solutions to all work together well. There was a time within my internship that there was conflict with lots of people in my group. I proposed a mediation and we all decided to talk it out and put out all of our ideas on the table to find a solution to our issues. I believe that this mediation I held allowed for the group to work together as one instead of working against each other. This allowed me to continue to build on my own problem solving skills alongside other skills needed for these types of situations. Overall, I would describe myself as a hardworking, dedicated, and responsible individual ready and willing to do whatever it takes for any potential endeavors I take on. I am someone who is not only a team leader but a team player, because for an organization to function at its best everyone has to be willing to work with one another. I have the skills necessary to cultivate a productive environment for not only myself but for all.
